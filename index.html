            Hello World, my name is Samira. I’m from Switzerland and am
            currently based in Basel. I am a designer who is on track to become
            a frontend web developer. Feel free to get in touch! <br />
            This website was created for the course „Webdevelopment with
            JavaScript“ by MIT which I started in March and completed in June
            2021.

              My name is Samira Liebendörfer I am 33 years old and am from
              Switzerland. I studied Visual Communication at the Academy of Art
              and Design in Basel with a focus on print design and typography.
              Afterwards I completed a few internships at an agency and smaller
              offices in the area of Graphic Design and Corporate Identity.
              <br />
              My field of expertise nowadays is UI and UX Design and I am
              training to become a frontend web developer. <br />

              <h2>Bio 2/2</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="mono">
              After working as an employee and freelancer as a Graphic Designer
              I decided to found my own office in the field of Graphic Design
              together with a long-term collaborator and friend. We mainly
              realized work in the field of Culture and the Arts. During that
              time I developed an interest in frontend web development and
              decided to go into that direction for my career. <br />
              I am currently involved in a traineeship at Prolog, a small
              company in Basel specialized in Strategy, Design and Code. <br />
              With a background in Graphic Design I combine a sense for
              aesthetic with a preference for digital solutions, sort of a
              hybrid. I am interested to combine function with design to create
              digital experiences.

# Samira’s Webdev Exploration

This page is intended to be the platform where I can present projects I’m building and assignments from the webdevelopment course I'm currently taking "Webdevelopment with JavaScript" from MIT. The idea is to add smaller exercises that help me understand concepts on my way to become a frontend developer, starting out with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is a work-in-progress place and will be adapted and growing in the future. 

### Features / Projects

- Task Generator
- JavaScript Memory Game


## Roadmap

- Layout and structure for the page itself

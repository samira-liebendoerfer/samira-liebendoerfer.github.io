            </div>
            <p class="mono">
              This exercise was about creating a game where one can first click
              on a button to create PacMen at a random position. The game is
              then started by by clicking on another button – the PacMen start
              to move with a random velocity. The challenge was to set the
              position of the PacMan, to detect collision with all walls and to
              make each PacMan bounce. The goal was also to learn on how to
              control the Document Object Model (DOM).

              This exercise was meant to explore what is possible when HTML,
              CSS, and JavaScript come together. It’s a web page with two eyes,
              where the eyeballs follow the mouse movement.

            <p class="mono">
              This exercise was all about adding animation to a map. MBTA bus
              data is being used to determine bus stops between Harvard and MIT.
              An animated marker is added on the map to highlight the bus
              routes.
